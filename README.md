### Roami
Roami is like a Pinterest-based image sharing web app, built with React and Django. This was a client project, and I have a demo hosted on vercel (https://roami.vercel.app) for those who are interested in checking it out. 

Some features: 
- User auth and Google auth
- Image uploads and sharing/embeds
- Following other users
- Paypal donations
- etc.

Tech stack:
- Django and DRF for the backend
- React for the frontend
- PostgreSQL for the database
- AWS and Vercel for the hosting and cloud services
